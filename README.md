Computational Perspectives on Workplace Dynamics and Mental Health in the Tech Industry: Insights from a Survey-Based Study.
This project explores how workplace policies and culture in the tech industry impact employees' mental health and their likelihood of seeking treatment, using data from the OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) survey. The study analyzes key factors such as mental health benefits, workplace stigma, and organizational support, and applies machine learning to predict whether an employee will seek treatment for mental illness. The goal is to gain insights into improving mental health support in the tech industry.

# Objectives
**Understand** the impact of organizational policies and workplace environments on whether employees seek treatment for mental illness. <br/>
**Analyze** key cultural factors that may contribute to mental health challenges or encourage treatment-seeking behavior. <br/>
**Predict** whether an employee will seek treatment for mental illness using machine learning techniques, based on survey data.

# Data Source

The data source for this project is the OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) survey, which gathers responses from tech industry employees on their experiences and attitudes toward mental health in the workplace. The survey measures factors like mental health benefits, stigma, and workplace support, aiming to raise awareness and improve conditions for employees facing mental health challenges in the tech sector.

# Summary of Key Findings

**Strong Predictors:** Family history of mental health issues, availability of care options, company size, interference of mental illness with work, and provision of mental health benefits were the strongest predictors of whether an employee would seek treatment. <br/>
**Stigma and Comfort:** Employees were more comfortable discussing physical health issues than mental health issues with their employers. Those who perceived that their employer treated mental health as seriously as physical health found it easier to take medical leave. <br/>
**Anonymity Concerns:** Concerns about anonymity and observing negative consequences for others influenced employees' willingness to discuss mental health or seek help. <br/>
**Care Options Awareness:** Awareness of and access to mental health care options increased the likelihood of employees seeking treatment. <br/>
These findings **highlight** the need for tech companies to create policies that treat mental health on par with physical health, destigmatize mental health issues, and improve communication and support for mental health benefits.

# Limitations and Future Directions

**Address Data Limitations:** The current dataset has demographic and geographic biases, with 55% of respondents from the US and a male majority, and includes only 1260 responses from 2016. Future work should focus on larger, more diverse, and recent datasets to improve representativeness.<br/>
**Cross-Industry Comparison:** Explore data from other industries such as healthcare, entertainment, and transportation to compare workplace mental health policies and environments across sectors.<br/>
**Incorporate Confounding Variables:** Include factors like personal stress levels, anxiety, and other health issues in future analyses to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting mental health and treatment-seeking behavior. <br/>
**Advanced Algorithms:** Experiment with additional machine learning techniques like CATBoost and gradient boosting to enhance model accuracy.<br/>
**NLP Analysis:** Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze employee comments and uncover meaningful patterns related to workplace mental health perceptions and experiences.
